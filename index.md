## About Me

<img align="right" src="./assets/imgs/ce_2022.png" width="150px" style="margin:10px 10px"/>

I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. The goal of my research is to make machine learning techniques widely accessible—while being cost-efficient and trustworthy—to everyone who wants to use them to make our world a better place. 

Before ETH, I finished my PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, both advised by [Chris Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/).
I did my undergraduate study at Peking University, advised by [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). 

With a background in data management, we believe in a system approach. Our current research focues on building next-generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-centric, human-centric, and declaratively scalable.

Check out a summary of our research [here](./docs/research.html). We are also building up two exciting start-ups:
  - **[Together Computer](https://www.together.xyz/)**: A decentralized cloud for 
artificial intelligence, with the mission to bring the world's computation together to support the open models ecosystem.
  - **[Modulos.AI](https://www.modulos.ai/)**: A data-centric AI enterprise platform helps you find the errors, noise and bias in your data so you can build fairer and better AI, faster.

As a research group, one of our most important duties is to nurture the next generation of leaders, which arguably gives us the most significant long-lasting impact to the society. Over the years, students graduated from our groups have became professors in great universities and researchers and engineers in leading industrial companies. See a list and their achievements [here](./docs/students.html).


We are super lucky to have been involved in several community building 
efforts, from 
machine learning systems, data management for ML, to Data-centric AI. 
Here are a few recent positioning papers on various topics (joint work 
with many fellow researchers):

- [Advances, challenges and opportunities in creating data for trustworthy AI
](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00516-1) (Nature Machine Intelligence), with Weixin Liang, Girmaw Tadesse, Daniel Ho, Li Fei-Fei, Matei Zaharia, and James Zou.
- [DataPerf: Benchmarks for Data-Centric AI Development (MLCommons)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10062), with a great consortium of researchers who are passionated about data quality for ML and
data iterations.
- [A Data Quality-Driven View of MLOps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07750) (IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin). 
- [MLSys: The New Frontier of Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03257), the positioning paper for the
first MLSys conference, with a awesome consortium of researchers from machine
learning, systems, data management, security, computer architecture, etc.
