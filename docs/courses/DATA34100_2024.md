## Introduction to Data Systems and Data Design

In this course, we will focus on data and the methods to model, organize, manage, and process data at scale using modern data systems. We will begin with data modeling—how to describe and model data, how to query it, and understand its logical semantics and properties. Next, we will explore ways to process and manage data, both relationally and using more flexible frameworks. Additionally, we will cover practical design principles such as schema design, integrity constraints, and an introduction to data management systems that help us understand performance and speed of data processing.

- **Date**: Monday/Wednesday
- **Time**: 01:30 pm - 02:50 pm
- **Place**: JCL	011
- **Contact**: Ce Zhang (cez@uchicago.edu)
- **Textbook**: **Database Systems: The Complete Book** (Jennifer Widom, Héctor García-Molina, Jeffrey Ullman)
    - We also frequently draw inspirations from _Foundations of Databases: The Logical Level_ (Serge Abiteboul, Richard Hull, Victor Vianu); it is not mandatory, but it is also an amazing book for understanding this course (and data in general)
